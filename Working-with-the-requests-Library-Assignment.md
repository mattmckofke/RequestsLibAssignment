### Practical Exercises üß∞

1. **Fetching Data from a Public API:**

   - **Task:** Write a Python script using the `requests` library to send a GET request to a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, GitHub API).
   - **Objective:**
     - Retrieve data from the API.
     - Parse the JSON response.
     - Display specific information extracted from the data.
   - **Example:** Fetch the current weather data for a specific city and print the temperature and weather description.

2. **Creating and Updating Resources:**

   - **Task:** Use the `requests` library to interact with a mock RESTful API (e.g., [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)).
     - **Part A:** Send a POST request to create a new resource (e.g., a new post).
     - **Part B:** Send a PUT or PATCH request to update the resource you just created.
   - **Objective:**
     - Understand how to send data in the request body.
     - Handle the API's response to confirm the creation and update.

3. **Error Handling and Status Codes:**

   - **Task:** Modify your scripts to include error handling.
     - Check the response's `status_code`.
     - Use `try-except` blocks to catch exceptions (e.g., `requests.exceptions.HTTPError`, `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`).
   - **Objective:**
     - Ensure your script can handle different HTTP status codes appropriately.
     - Provide meaningful error messages to the user.

4. **Implementing Timeouts and Retries:**

   - **Task:** Adjust your requests to include a timeout parameter and implement a retry mechanism for failed requests.
   - **Objective:**
     - Prevent your script from hanging indefinitely.
     - Handle transient network errors by retrying failed requests.

### Assignment üìù

**Project: Building a Simple API Client**

- **Objective**: Build a command-line Python application that interacts with a chosen public API to perform a useful function.
- **Requirements**:
  - Use the `requests` library to send HTTP requests.
  - Implement at least one GET request and one POST request.
  - Include error handling for network issues and API errors.
  - Handle authentication if required by the API.
  - Present the data in a user-friendly format (e.g., formatted output, saving to a file).

**üî• EXTRA CREDIT: Authentication:**

- **Task:** Access a protected API endpoint that requires authentication (e.g., GitHub API endpoints that require a token).
  - Include the necessary authentication in your request.
- **Objective:**
  - Learn how to include authentication credentials in your requests.
  - Understand how authentication affects access to API resources.
